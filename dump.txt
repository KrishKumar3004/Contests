The Prime Minister had cited the poll outcome to suggest that his party was being embraced by minorities as well. "Minorities were fearful about The BJP for years but the poeple of Goa and, now from the Northeast, have exposed such propaganda. The Christians in Nagaland and Meghalaya keep supporting us,"Modi has said after the results were announced on Thursday.
